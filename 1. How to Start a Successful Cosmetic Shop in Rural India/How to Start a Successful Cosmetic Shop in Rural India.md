Scaling your cosmetic shop involves several steps:

1. **Expand Product Range**: Once you have a steady customer base and understand their preferences, consider expanding your product range. This could include introducing new brands or types of products.

2. **Improve Customer Experience**: Focus on improving the customer experience. This could be through better store layout, improved customer service, or offering personalized recommendations.

3. **Marketing and Promotion**: Invest in marketing and promotion to attract new customers. This could be through local advertising, social media marketing, or word-of-mouth referrals.

4. **Partnerships**: Consider partnering with local beauty salons or spas. They could recommend your products to their customers.

The 20% of products that give 80% of the return, often referred to as the Pareto Principle, can vary greatly depending on the specific market and customer preferences. Here are some general steps to identify those products:

1. **Sales Data Analysis**: Look at your sales data to identify which products are selling the most. These are likely to be your 20% that provide 80% of your returns.

2. **Market Research**: Understand what products are popular in the market. This can be done by observing trends, speaking with customers, and researching online.

3. **Customer Feedback**: Listen to your customers. They can provide valuable insights into what products they prefer and why.

4. **Trial and Error**: Sometimes, it takes a bit of experimentation to find out what works best. Try different products and see which ones sell the most.

Remember, the 20/80 rule is a guideline, not a hard rule. The actual ratio can vary. The key is to focus on the products that provide the most return on investment. Good luck! ðŸ˜Š
